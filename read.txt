A wonderful movie that is built on emotions. Very aptly showcases how well bonded and connected  relationships can build a fortune while relationships standing on ego and distrust destroys not just self but also the dear ones !

Nani has done justice (more or less) to his title Natural Star (he could have broken down while he asks the kiddo if there was any shortcomings in his love than controlling - would have been a more natural extension).  

The young and sweet kiddo Kiara has carried the role with elegance and done a brilliant work. Mrunal Thakur was just great touching the right chords !!

All other supporting actors have played thier roles well.

The great twists and turns throughout the movie are admirable and support the cause of the story !

Overall, a very good family entertainer.
